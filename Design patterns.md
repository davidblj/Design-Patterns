One thing expert designers know not to do is solve every problem from first principles.
Rather, **they reuse solutions that have worked for them in the past**. When they find a
good solution, **they use it again and again**. Such experience is part of what makes them
experts. Consequently, you'll find recurring patterns of classes and communicating
objects in many object-oriented systems.These patterns solve specific design problems
and **make object-oriented designs more flexible,elegant, and ultimately reusable**. They
help designers **reuse successful designs** by basing new designs on prior experience.
A designer who is familiar with such patterns can **apply them immediately to design
problems without having to rediscover them**

## Creational patterns

Creational design **patterns abstract the instantiation process**. They help make a system
independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. Acl ass creational
pattern uses inheritance to vary the class that's instantiated, whereas an object
creational pattern will delegate instantiation to another object.

## Structural patterns 

Structural patterns are concerned with how **classes and objects are composed to form
larger structures**

Rather than composing interfaces or implementations, structural object patterns describe
ways to **compose objects to realize new functionality**. The added flexibility of
object composition comes from the ability to change **the composition at run-time**, which
is impossible with static class composition.

## Behavioral patterns

Behavioral patterns are **concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities
between objects**. Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes
but also the **patterns of communication between them**. These patterns characterize
complex control flow that's difficult to follow at run-time. They **shift** your focus away
from **flow of control** to let you concentrate just on the way **objects are interconnected**. 

Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes

Behavioral object patterns use object composition rather than inheritance
